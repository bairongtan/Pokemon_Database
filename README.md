The target browers for my project are most of the contemporary browsers available. 

These include Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. 

## Description of my project

For my database, I decided to utilize the website breaches api by 
haveibeenpwned which specializes in collected data on data breaches. 

The link to the api is https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v2/breaches.

For visualizations, my project uses Chartjs and specifically its pie chart capabilities to
accurately represent the website breach data from my api.

My project was written and developed using HTML/JS/CSS framework.

The purpose of my project is to showcase what the number and types of data that 
have been leaked in numerous website breaches across several different years.
