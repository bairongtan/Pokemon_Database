The title of my project is the Website Breaches Database.

This project is targetted towards most of the contemporary browsers available. 
These include Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. 

## Description of my project

For my database, I decided to utilize the website breaches api by 
haveibeenpwned which specializes in collected data on data breaches. 
The link to the api is https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v2/breaches.

For visualizations, my project uses Chartjs and specifically its pie chart capabilities to
accurately represent the website breach data from my api.

My project was written and developed using HTML/Js/CSS framework.

The purpose of my project is to showcase what the number and types of data that 
have been leaked in numerous website breaches over time.
